# Michał Szymański - ELEKS recruitment task 
## General info

Due to lack of time, I didn't make it as I wanted to, especially I would do some things in different way if I had time:
- I would use page objects instead of selecting every objects directly in specs file
- I would use faker
- I would prepare more e2e tests, especially case that covers e.g. password simplicity tips
- I would prepare more api tests in Jest, instead of that I used clear JS

Please note that I never used webdriver.io before.

To run e2e tests just type `npm run wddio`.

To run api tests just type `npm run test:api:new`.


To all specs pass, you need to register user with mail 'b@b.b' and pass 'pass1'.
